;; hungry-delete.el - hungry delete minor mode

;; Version: 1.0
;;
;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains all the necessary functions and macros, taken from
;; cc-mode, to implement hungry deletion without relying on cc-mode.  This
;; allows it to be used more easily in all modes, as it is now a minor mode in
;; it's own right.  global-hungry-delete-mode will turn on hungry-delete-mode in
;; all buffers.
;;
;; To use this mode, just put the following in your .emacs file:
;;
;; (require 'hungry-delete)
;; (global-hungry-delete-mode)

;; Code:
